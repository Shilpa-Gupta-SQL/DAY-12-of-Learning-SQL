This repository documents my hands-on learning and practice of core MySQL concepts essential for real-world database development and administration.
Topics covered include handling duplicate records using GROUP BY and HAVING, JOIN-based duplicate detection, MySQL architecture and characteristics, built-in functions, user-defined functions (UDFs), stored procedures, triggers, events, and ERD fundamentals.

The goal of this repository is to strengthen my understanding of data integrity, query optimization, database logic, and schema design, while building a strong foundation for SQL developer and DBA roles.
